Hello!  Welcome to my Software Engineering Journey.
You are either reading this when I am just beginning, or reading this as I look for my first job!  
I'm Derek, I love currently in Enumclaw, Washington.
I have a great wife, and 7 wonderful kids.
I want to be, and hopefully am a Software Engineer as you read this...

Stay awhile and listen!
